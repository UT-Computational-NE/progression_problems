# UT-Austin Nuclear Progression Problems documentation

This repository defines a series of progression problems designed to evaluate the
capability and maturity of reactor physics modeling and simulation tools for various
nuclear reactor systems.  This effort was started under the University of Texas
at Austin (UTA) Digital Molten Salt Reactor Initiative (DMSRI).
