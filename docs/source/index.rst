UT-Austin Nuclear Progression Problems documentation
====================================================

Welcome to the UT Austin Nuclear Engineering Progression Problems. This repository defines a series of **progression problems** designed to evaluate the capability and maturity of reactor physics modeling and simulation tools for various nuclear reactor systems.

These problems serve several key purposes:

- **Assessment:** Provide structured benchmarks for assessing the suitability of modeling and simulation tools.
- **Prioritization:** Help guide and prioritize code development efforts.
- **Transparency:** Offer clear, measurable metrics for evaluating progress and communicating development status to stakeholders and users.
- **Guidance:** Define how specific modeling features should be applied and interpreted to ensure proper use and reproducibility.

Together, these objectives support an efficient, transparent, and focused approach to advancing the state of nuclear systems modeling and simulation.
